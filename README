# Neo4j::TestBot - Create and run graph data unit tests

`Neo4j::TestBot` provides a system for creating, running, and
logging comprehensive tests of graph metadata. It allows the QA user to
write simple and well-annotated tests based on metadata database
queries. Tests can be grouped in single files based on topic or other
logical grouping. All test files may be run together using familiar
Perl tools. Test results are streamed in [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/), a
simple standard that is understood by test aggregation and statistics
generators in several programming languages.

Tests are specified in a relatively simple syntax, with a name,
description, associated database queries, a method for evaluation of
the queries and expected results. Queries are made in Neo4j Cypher and
executed against any Neo4j instance of the graph metadata. General query 
evaluators are provided by the module to reduce hand-coding.

When tests fail (or if logging level is set to DEBUG), test
information and the JSON results of test Cypher queries are stored in
a specified directory with timestamps and meaningful file names. The
idea is to simplify the follow up analysis of failing tests and help
get to root causes faster.

The main motivation for `Neo4j::TestBot::Data` is to reduce the energy
barrier to creating and regularly executing data tests. It attempts to
make it easy to quickly add a new test based on any new data fault,
and to run these tests as regressions automatically and to generate
automated reports of failures regularly. This should make it easier to
identify data or code changes responsible for data regressions and so
solve them more rapidly, when changes are fresh in the minds of the
team.
